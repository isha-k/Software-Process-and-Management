# Software-Process-and-Management
Project involved working within coordinated teams to manage and develop software. 

The software is for markers and students who need to track student contributions to a group task. The time/task tracker is a web app that tracks which activity each student completes for a project, and the time they spend on the given activity. Unlike traditional marking styles the product allows the marker to handle tricky situations such as ensuring fairness, getting a correct evaluation of student participation and also allows for increased transparency between the student and the marker.

Project development followed a process similar to Scrum. 

Languages used for developing the time/task tracker: Python, SQL, Javascript, HTML, CSS
